<h1>Fetching data with React</h1>

<p>â€¢ This project was built for study purposes.<p>


<p>The user's Github repositories data is fetched using React, Axios and React-Query. Because the <i>Stale While Revalidate</i> functionality from React-Query is implemented, cached assets are used if they are found in the cache, and then they are revalidated and updated with a newer version of the asset.</p>
